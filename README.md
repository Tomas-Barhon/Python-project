# Python-project
This is a python project for out subject Data Processing in Python (JEM207) belonging to Tomáš Barhoň and Radim Plško.
We will be studying the impact of different makroeconomical and socio-economical indicators that might be the driving forces for an increased criminality in different regions in the czech republic.
We would like to thank the creators of the database including all the cities in Czech Republic which we will use.
The main data source will be the https://kriminalita.policie.cz/ API that contains information about all sorts of crimes and their geographical location.
